# Decibel Detector

a.k.a. Deci Detect

## OS?
Windows, because I use windows, and that's about it.

## Usage
Not much, but it was a fun project to work on. You can however play around with it, try to get the smallest or largest possible amount of decibels.

## Help

> Pause - Enter / Return / Break
> Exit - Escape / Esc

## Resources
None, I don't like installing libraries, so it's pretty much all from scratch (except for built in libraries e.g. windows api)
